# chat-to-pdf-converter

The interface is a web-based application designed to convert chat conversations into a PDF format. The main color scheme is a gradient of dark grays, providing a sleek and modern look. The UI contains three key sections:

1. A navigation bar at the top with an 'Upload PDF' button on the left, prominent and easy to access, styled with a light gray color contrasting with the dark background.

2. The central area is divided into two main parts. On the left, there is a sidebar with a list view displaying two PDF files, 'smartwatch_user_guide.pdf' and 'CV.pdf', with checkboxes beside each to select them. The list items and checkboxes are smaller in size, providing a minimalistic feel.

3. The right-hand side is the main content area, showing a large, interactive PDF viewer window that takes up most of the screen space. The PDF viewer has its own navigation bar with icons for different viewing options (such as zoom and page navigation) and is bordered by a light gray outline. The viewer displays a 'SMART WATCH USER GUIDE' with text and interactive elements such as hyperlinks.

4. At the bottom of the PDF viewer, there is an 'Ask any question' feature with a text input box, encouraging user interaction.

5. A distinctive feature is the 'Drag and drop your PDF file here' box in the center of the PDF viewer, which is outlined with a dashed line and includes an upload icon, suggesting an interactive upload feature for convenience.

6. Text elements throughout the UI should use a sans-serif font, providing a modern and clean aesthetic. The main text is white, offering a high contrast against the dark background for readability.

7. The overall layout is clean and well-organized, with ample spacing between elements to avoid clutter. The design should be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes while maintaining usability.
